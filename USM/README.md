## Why ?

Services can be run across multiple services, we need to agrigate them in order to have a single pane of glass so we can see the overall performance.
Code change isn't needed, but the agents configuration needs to be updated. It's currently limited to Linux+container or Windows IIS+VM.

The power of this functionality comes from the DD tags.

This data can be linked with monitors/alerts and SLOs.
